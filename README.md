# CS2820 Fall 2025 WARP Project Code
This version 2.0 code base will be used for the University of Iowa 
CS 2820 Introduction to Software Development course. The code was 
developed by Steve Goddard for the WARP sensor network research project. 
It was first written in Swift and rewritten in Java. It was then 
rewritten again in an object-oriented programming style. It was a quick
hack, and it needs a lot of cleanup and refactoring. A perfect code base to teach
the value of software developement fundamentals!
<br>
This latest version (2.0) contains a full Graphical User Interface (GUI) and 
updated windows for displaying reports, tables, and GraphStream graphs. This 
version has also undergone signficant refactoring of GUI-related code, Warp.java, 
and the factory classes.
